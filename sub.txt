29:09.414 --> 29:11.582
...he is scarce
to pay his rents.

29:11.583 --> 29:13.667
His people starve each winter,

29:13.668 --> 29:16.087
yet even he shinied up this...

29:17.505 --> 29:19.381
bauble from
his family's cellars,

29:19.382 --> 29:22.384
for he understands
that all men, in their way,

29:22.385 --> 29:25.930
wish only for your help,
or your head.

29:28.892 --> 29:30.518
You've come for my head, then.

29:32.103 --> 29:33.687
W-What?

29:33.688 --> 29:36.106
No! No.

29:36.107 --> 29:40.403
Then, why the fuck
are you in my tent?

29:45.158 --> 29:46.659
S-Supper.

29:53.541 --> 29:55.209

29:59.255 --> 30:00.673

30:02.884 --> 30:04.551
Actually makes sense.

30:04.552 --> 30:06.930
- Supper.
- What is your name, man?

30:08.765 --> 30:10.057
Dunk-- Ser Dunk.

30:10.058 --> 30:11.518
That's ridiculous.

31:44.319 --> 31:45.861
[music ends abruptly]

31:45.862 --> 31:49.407
The swells heaved.
You could lick
salt from the air.

31:51.117 --> 31:54.287
But I'd come to find
what men do
when they die at sea.

31:56.039 --> 31:59.042
So, drove I on
into the storm.

32:00.043 --> 32:02.045
[laughing]

32:03.713 --> 32:06.466
- Weren't you afraid?
- Ahh.

32:09.928 --> 32:11.971
Within every man,
there are many men.

32:13.765 --> 32:15.223
Mm.

32:15.224 --> 32:19.019
But that I had to do,
Stormlanders had always done.

32:19.020 --> 32:22.065
And if they had done it,
I could do it, too.

32:23.274 --> 32:24.275
Hm.

32:25.193 --> 32:27.028
You know, it's best
not to agonize.

32:30.406 --> 32:33.409
Yeah, I-- I agonize a lot.

32:34.410 --> 32:35.744
[Lyonel] Mm.

32:35.745 --> 32:38.872
Sometimes, I-- I think
I agonize too much,

32:38.873 --> 32:41.334
and I just end up
agonizing over that.
[chuckles]

32:42.377 --> 32:43.752
Mm.

32:43.753 --> 32:46.922
And I'm quick and strong, sure.

32:46.923 --> 32:49.091
- Sure.
- But so are you.

32:49.092 --> 32:50.634
Sure.

32:50.635 --> 32:53.136
Plus, you've trained
sword and lance

32:53.137 --> 32:55.555
with the finest
masters-at-arms in the realm.

32:55.556 --> 32:56.683
I mean...

32:57.725 --> 33:00.645
what chance do I have?
Truly?

33:01.813 --> 33:04.357
Oh, you have no chance.
[chuckles]

33:06.067 --> 33:07.235
[Dunk sighs]

33:09.862 --> 33:14.158
But it's a great honor to test
oneself against a worthy foe.

33:16.452 --> 33:19.329
- No disrespect, ser.
- Mm.

33:19.330 --> 33:20.914
That's easy for you to say.

33:20.915 --> 33:24.418
You have a name,
an inheritance.

33:24.419 --> 33:28.255
One loss, and I won't be able
to ransom back my own horse.

33:28.256 --> 33:30.507

33:30.508 --> 33:32.134
[chuckles softly]

33:32.135 --> 33:34.178
[both laughing]

33:35.263 --> 33:37.515
A knight without a horse
is no knight at all.

33:38.391 --> 33:40.393
- Aye.
- Mm.

33:41.644 --> 33:43.937
- [mug scraping]
- [Lyonel sipping loudly]

33:43.938 --> 33:45.189
So, what should I do?

33:49.694 --> 33:51.112
I don't know.

33:53.990 --> 33:55.700
I'm really quite drunk.

34:00.204 --> 34:02.206
[stomping, grunting]

34:04.125 --> 34:05.126
Okay.

34:06.210 --> 34:07.211
Thanks.

34:07.962 --> 34:08.963
[sighs]

34:09.714 --> 34:11.799
[hiccuping]
Sorry.

Ser Arlan of Pennytree.

34:36.741 --> 34:38.742
He-- he served your Lord Father

34:38.743 --> 34:40.828
to hunt the Vulture King
in the Red Mountains.

34:41.621 --> 34:42.829
I-- I was only a boy, but--

34:42.830 --> 34:44.332
I thought you said
you were a Dornishman.

34:45.416 --> 34:47.709
No, he said he's hung
like a Dornishman.

34:47.710 --> 34:50.421
No, I said
I've hung Dornishmen.

34:52.924 --> 34:54.716
Perhaps we would speak
on the morn.

34:54.717 --> 34:56.510

penny knight not.

34:56.511 --> 34:59.012
Nor you, brother.
Be gone.

34:59.013 --> 35:00.348
[chuckles]

35:03.142 --> 35:06.228
But Ser Arlan took a wound
in your father's service.

How could you have
forgotten him?

35:09.023 --> 35:10.565

35:10.566 --> 35:13.860
My lord father
took 800 swords
into those mountains.

35:13.861 --> 35:17.198
We've forgotten men
who reaped much more
than a wound.

35:17.949 --> 35:20.867
Please, ser, I-- I will not
be allowed to challenge

35:20.868 --> 35:23.371
unless a knight
or a lord will vouch for me.

35:23.788 --> 35:24.622
And what is that to me?

- [horse nickering]
- What are you doing?

35:58.281 --> 36:01.158
Cooking a fish.
Do you want some?

36:01.159 --> 36:04.494
No. I mean,
how did you get here?

36:04.495 --> 36:05.954
Did you steal a horse?

36:05.955 --> 36:07.789
I rode in the back
of a lamb cart.

36:07.790 --> 36:10.084
[scoffs]
Lamb cart.

36:11.711 --> 36:14.171
- Well, you best
find another one.
- You can't make me go.

36:14.172 --> 36:16.089
I'd had enough of that inn.

36:16.090 --> 36:19.509
Now, listen,
I'll have no more
insolence from you, boy.

36:19.510 --> 36:22.262
I should throw you
over my horse
and take you home.

36:22.263 --> 36:24.764
You'd need to ride
all the way
to King's Landing.

36:24.765 --> 36:27.268
- You'd miss the tourney.
- King's Landing?

36:28.269 --> 36:30.188
- You're from Flea Bottom?
- No.

36:31.939 --> 36:32.940
Aye.

36:40.615 --> 36:42.115
What are those doing there?

36:42.116 --> 36:44.284
I washed them.
I made the fire,

36:44.285 --> 36:46.620
caught the fish,
and groomed the horses.

36:46.621 --> 36:48.496
I would have raised
your pavilion,

36:48.497 --> 36:49.832
but I couldn't find one.

36:51.042 --> 36:53.376
- There's my pavilion.
- That's a tree.

36:53.377 --> 36:56.005
Yes, and it's all the pavilion
a true knight needs.

36:57.006 --> 36:59.884

than in some smoky tent.

37:01.552 --> 37:03.470

37:10.645 --> 37:11.938
What's your name?

37:13.105 --> 37:15.565
- Dunk.
- Ser Dunk.

37:15.566 --> 37:18.945
That's no name for a knight.
Is it short for Duncan?

37:19.779 --> 37:21.988
Yeah.
[clearing throat] Yes.

37:21.989 --> 37:23.699

Ser Duncan the Tall.

Never heard of him.

Well, Egg, by rights,
I should beat you bloody,

you don't eat much.

37:53.938 --> 37:55.230

37:55.231 --> 37:57.400
And if you'll swear
to do as you're told...

37:59.652 --> 38:01.153
I'll let you serve me
for the tourney.

38:04.031 --> 38:05.157
After that, well...

38:07.660 --> 38:08.744
we'll see.

38:11.622 --> 38:15.293
I don't have much,
but if you prove
worth your keep...

38:16.919 --> 38:19.255
you'll have clothes on your back
and food in your belly.

38:20.464 --> 38:22.882
The clothes
might be rough-spun
and the food,

38:22.883 --> 38:24.926
salt beef and salt fish,

38:24.927 --> 38:26.220
but you won't go hungry.
